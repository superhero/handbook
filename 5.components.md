### @superhero/config

###### [@superhero/config](/components/@superhero/config.md)

A lightweight configuration loader that supports environment-based overrides. It enables a service to load context-aware settings via files, environment variables, or in-memory injections, aligning with infrastructure abstraction best practices.

---

### @superhero/core

###### [@superhero/core](/components/@superhero/core.md)

The application framework and contextual lifecycle container. It provides service discovery, lifecycle orchestration, clustering, dependency hierarchy and graceful service termination. It's mainly a composition layer of other lower level components in the tool chain.

---

### @superhero/date

###### [@superhero/date](/components/@superhero/date.md)

Provides utility functions for working with JavaScript `Date` objects in a safer and more predictable way. Emphasizes clarity around time zones, formatting, and interval math for process and infrastructure layers.

---

### @superhero/deep

###### [@superhero/deep](/components/@superhero/deep.md)

Includes deep manipulation functions for nested objects—such as merging, cloning, and diffing—used in event payload normalization, schema validation, or internal transformation layers.

---

### @superhero/eventflow

###### [@superhero/eventflow](/components/@superhero/eventflow.md)

A message queue solution, designed to manage events and eventlogs. The model is also built to help developers support eventsource behaviour in the solutions they base the model on.

---

### @superhero/http-request

###### [@superhero/http-request](/components/@superhero/http-request.md)

Provides a standardized wrapper for making outbound HTTP(S.md) requests. Offers timeout, retry, and structured response handling consistent with the stack’s observable and testable design philosophy.

---

### @superhero/http-server

###### [@superhero/http-server](/components/@superhero/http-server.md)

Exposes a component-based HTTP server with middleware support. Designed for running isolated services and exposing APIs, it includes hooks for attaching API layers and route-based observers.

---

### @superhero/id-name-generator

###### [@superhero/id-name-generator](/components/@superhero/id-name-generator.md)

Generates unique, human-readable identifiers—suitable for naming deployments, event streams, or test environments. Uses pluggable dictionaries of adjectives and nouns to produce randomized names.

---

### @superhero/locator

###### [@superhero/locator](/components/@superhero/locator.md)

A dependency resolution and service discovery module, used to link modules and wiring configurations at runtime. It ensures that services can be resolved by name and injected into one another explicitly.

---

### @superhero/log

###### [@superhero/log](/components/@superhero/log.md)

Structured, leveled logger that outputs consistent logs for auditing, debugging, and observability. Supports labeled categories and timestamp precision to support distributed tracing across components.

---

### @superhero/oas

###### [@superhero/oas](/components/@superhero/oas.md)

A layer on top of the `@superhero/http-server` and `@superhero/router` to validate and route endpoints/operations using OpenAPI specifications.

---

### @superhero/openssl

###### [@superhero/openssl](/components/@superhero/openssl.md)

A Node.js wrapper for essential OpenSSL functions, used internally by certificate and identity-related components. Enables programmatic key/certificate creation, inspection, and signing.

---

### @superhero/path-resolver

###### [@superhero/path-resolver](/components/@superhero/path-resolver.md)

A common module used by other core components, used to resolves a contextual or relative paths at runtime. Simplifies location-based references for files and folders, supporting configurations of a specific base context relative to the intended path to resolve.

---

### @superhero/router

###### [@superhero/router](/components/@superhero/router.md)

Modular router for APIs and message dispatching. Supports versioned routes, async middleware chains, and message observers. Connects the API layer to process and domain logic in a predictable fashion.

---

### @superhero/tcp-record-channel

###### [@superhero/tcp-record-channel](/components/@superhero/tcp-record-channel.md)

A low level TCP socket channel module that handles persistent connections with record-framed payloads. Used by the Eventflow solution, and could be used in other service-to-service communications, to ensure secure and ordered framed message delivery.

---

### @superhero/wild-trie

###### [@superhero/wild-trie](/components/@superhero/wild-trie.md)

A Trie (DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph) data-structure implementation with wildcard support for graph path pattern matching. A lower level solution that can be used to model and navigate different tree structures.
